### Registering with us

Splittable makes shared living simple. The App allows you to keep track of everything people in your house (House) are spending money on – from rent to toilet roll, utility bills to nights out. When you download the App you will be asked whether you would like to set up a new House or whether you have an invitation to join an existing House set up on the App.

#### New House

Setting up a new House is easy. You will be asked to enter the House name or address, a valid postcode and country. To complete creation of the House account you can either sign up by:

- providing your email address together with your first and last name; or
- using your Facebook account.

Once your House is set up, you can invite people you live with you to join either from your contacts list or by entering their details manually.

#### Joining an existing House

If you have been invited to join a House you will receive an invite code by SMS or email, which you can enter to join the House once you've downloaded the App.

#### Rules for Registering

To register on the App you must be at least 18 years of age or any older age legally required under local law to bind yourself legally to these terms and conditions. If you choose to register with us you confirm you meet this minimum eligibility criterion.

To register you must provide us with accurate, complete and up-to date contact information, including your name, telephone number, address and email address. You are responsible for the information you provide to us. You must promptly update your account information in the event of any changes to this information.

Registration is subject to approval by us in all cases, and we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to decline any application for registration, without giving a reason.

#### Passwords

Upon registration for an account with us, you will be asked to create a password. You must keep your password confidential at all times and use it only to access and use your account and not for any other purpose. You are the only authorised member of your account and, accordingly, you must not disclose your password to anyone else. You should contact us immediately upon discovering any unauthorised use of your account or error in the operation of your password (see Contacting us). Any breach of these terms and conditions and/or any use of your account by anyone to whom you disclose your password will be treated as if the breach or use had been carried out by you, and will not relieve you of your obligations to us.

We reserve the right to alter or replace them, or require you to do so, at any time in our sole discretion.

### Using the App and making payments

Members can add details of payments they or other House members have already made or will make in the future. Costs can be classified in a number of different categories including, for example, Food & Groceries, Utilities, and/or Rent and different members of the House can be listed as the party responsible for managing each payment. You can view details of the House's payment history as well as upcoming payments using functionality we make available in the App.

The App allows members to record payments that have been made to House members offline. You can also make payments directly to other House members using the App.

In order to make and receive payments to and from another House member you and they will need to provide the following information:

- first and last name;
- date of birth;
- nationality;
- address; and
- details of your bank account.

You will be prompted by the App to provide the foregoing information to us in the payment section when you first try to make a payment. You are not obliged to provide this information to us, but if you do not you will not be able to make payments using the App.

Please note that you will not be able to pay a House member until that member has also registered to use the payment service by providing the information above. If you attempt to make a payment to a House member who is not registered, we will alert the House member to that attempt and send them a request to add their payment registration information.

We reserve the right, in our discretion, to carry out checks (including checks with credit reference agencies) for the purposes of confirming your identity and to establish your creditworthiness. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you agree to our doing so.

You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. Please note it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.

Payments made on the App are made through our payment gateway provider, MangoPay. You will be providing credit or debit card and bank account information directly to MangoPay which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information which you supply to MangoPay is not within our control and is subject to MangoPay's own privacy policy and terms and conditions available on via this link https://www.mangopay.com/terms/end-user-terms-and-conditions/Mangopay_Terms-EN.pdf. By registering to make payment directly to other House members using the App you confirm that you accept and agree to be bound by MangoPay's terms and acknowledge that they constitute a legally binding contract between MangoPay any you.

### Access to the App

The App may only be downloaded, accessed and used on a device owned or controlled by you and running the relevant operating system for which the App concerned was designed, so you must make sure you have a compatible device which meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to download the App you wish to download and to access and use the App.

You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owner of any device that is controlled, but not owned, by you to download the App to that device. You accept responsibility, in accordance with this EULA, for all access to, and use of, the App by you on any device, whether or not it is owned by you.

You acknowledge that the mobile service provider for the device to which you download, or on which you access or use, the App may charge for internet access (including mobile data usage) on that device.

We cannot and do not guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the App or that the App will respond at a certain speed (since this depends on a number of factors outside our control).

### What you are allowed to do

You may only use the App for non-commercial, personal use and only in accordance with this EULA (and in accordance with any applicable terms of any relevant third party service provider for the device to which you download, or on which you access or use, the App) and only for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and regulations), and in a responsible manner.

Subject to the following sections, you may retrieve and display content from the App on a computer or mobile device and store the App in electronic form incidentally in the normal course of use of your browser or mobile device. Additional terms may also apply to certain features, parts or content of the App and, where they apply, will be displayed on-screen or accessible via a link.

### Intellectual property rights

We license, but do not sell, to you the App you download. We remain the owners of the App at all times.

All intellectual property rights in the App and in any content of the App (including text, graphics, software, photographs and other images, videos, sound, trade marks and logos), other than Member Content, are owned by us or our licensors. Except as expressly set out here, nothing in this EULA gives you any rights in respect of any intellectual property owned by us or our licensors and you acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by downloading the App or any content from the App.

The App may contain code, commonly referred to as open source software, which is distributed under any of the many known variations of open source licence terms, including terms which allow the free distribution and modification of the relevant software’s source code and/or which require all distributors to make such source code freely available upon request, including any contributions or modifications made by such distributor (collectively, Open Source Software). Please note that, to the extent that the App contains any Open Source Software, that element only is licensed to you under the relevant licence terms of the applicable third party licensor (Open Source Licence Terms) and not under this EULA, and you accept and agree to be bound by such Open Source Licence Terms. A copy of the source code for any Open Source Software contained in the App and the relevant Open Source Licence Terms will be made available to you upon request.

### Member content

The App allows you to submit member-generated content (Member Content) and may also allow you to communicate that content, either to selected recipients or to House members in public or semi-public areas (Member Content Areas). We do not control Member Content submitted, nor are Member Content Areas actively moderated. You are solely responsible for Member Content as submitted by you and acknowledge that all Member Content expresses the views of its respective authors, and not our views.

If you submit any Member Content, you must:

- keep it relevant to the purpose of the Member Content Area to which you submit it and the nature of any topic;

- not submit any Member Content that is unlawful, threatening, abusive, libellous, pornographic, obscene, vulgar, indecent, offensive or which infringes on the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party;

- not submit any Member Content that contains any viruses and/or other code that has contaminating or destructive elements; and

- not impersonate, or misrepresent an affiliation with, any person or entity.

You agree that, by submitting any Member Content, you grant us and our affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sub-licensable right and licence to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Member Content (in whole or part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology, and you waive any moral rights you may have in, or to be identified as the author, of such Member Content.

Whilst we do not pre-screen Member Content, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delete, edit or modify any Member Content submitted by you and/or to close any discussion topic, at any time without notice to you.

Complaints about the content of any Member Content must be sent to contact@splittable.co and must contain details of the specific Member Content giving rise to the complaint.

### Third party platform providers and application stores

Certain third party platform providers with whose devices and/or operating systems the App have been designed to be compatible oblige us to include certain additional provisions in this EULA. These are set out at the end of this EULA under Additional third party terms. These provisions come from the relevant third party platform providers, not us.

Third party application stores are operated by the relevant third party platform providers and/or their affiliates. You must comply with all applicable terms of service, rules and policies applying to any third party application store from which you download the App. We are not responsible for these stores or (with the exception of the App) for anything provided by them and do not guarantee that they will be continuously available.

Where the App makes content available, you acknowledge that such content may be updated at any time.
